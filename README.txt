Lab Summary
This lab helped students understand the concept of linked lists as well as helped students
further understant pointers.  In this lab students had to write a linked list library themselves and use their
library in order to create, manipulate, and remove a linked list as well as sort it.  The algorithms in this lab
were more complicated than in the previous yet not that bad .  This lab took more of an understanding of pointers
however in order to complete.

Approach:
I approached the lab by first starting to work on the different functions in the Linked List Library (that
alliteration though) and eventually moved onto the functions within the main class.  By first starting by 
coding the functions I'm able to test each one to make sure it works and then trust them when I use them
in the larger and more important parts of the program.

Conclusion:
I spend about 10 hours on this lab, the most amount of time on any lab so far as I had an error which I was unable
to figure out without the help of the TA's. It ended up working nice and was rewarding when I was finally finished.
I liked the harder algorithms and disliked the pointer and function logic which messed me up on some of the
functions I had implemented.  The hardest parts were the algorithms but those were quite fun as well and I enjoyed
trying to figure them out.  The lab manual was nice although it would have been better if it was more precise and
concise. Class discussions definitely helped with this lab.
